By observing the inertial adjustment capability embodied on animal appendages, researchers have been inspired to apply inertial adjustment mechanisms to terrestrial robotics to enhance their maneuverability. Particularly, researchers found that tails and tail-like appendage mechanisms are the optimal means of inertial adjustment for terrestrial robot applications. However, existing robotic tails' inertial adjustment capability still lags far behind their biological counterparts, which limits the robots' capability of achieving various agile behaviors."}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"The objective of this thesis project is to propose novel spatial morphable inertial tail designs with enhanced inertial adjustment capability in three-dimension (3D) space and investigate its capability in assisting agile maneuvers for terrestrial robots.
